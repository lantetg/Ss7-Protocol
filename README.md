## <a id="ss7"></a> 📁 〢 What is Ss7?
The current standard, since its introduction and adoption in the middle of the 1970s, SS7 (also known as Common Channel Signaling System No. 7 or C7), hasn't made many strides in recent years. It is highly vulnerable to hackers because of its antiquated security principles.

In a sense, SS7's popularity has also become a curse. At least in terms of online security. Everywhere uses the SS7 protocol, the most widely used method of global network connections, due to its widespread use by both mobile providers and intelligence organizations. It is remarkably effective from a monitoring standpoint. Because it gives hackers access to the same surveillance tools used by intelligence and law enforcement organizations, SS7 is a suspect's closest buddy.


SS7 attacks use the capabilities of communication systems that are built on top of the SS7 protocol to authenticate themselves to snoop on text and voice communications. A Linux-based system and the SS7 SDK, which can be downloaded free of charge online, are all a hacking group would need to start an SS7 strike.

When a hacker connects to an SS7 system, he or she can start targeting customers while deceiving the network into believing the attacker device is an MSC/VLR node.
